TODO

## How it Works

`cu-api` uses `puppeteer` a headless browser to act like a user and login. When logged in it access the backend api to grab the data needed. This backend api is used by the `buffportal` system for displaying everything.

## Requirements

You must have node installed and a headless browser must be able to work on your system.
